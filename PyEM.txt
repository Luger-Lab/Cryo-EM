#moving particles motion corrected/CTF corrected in cryosparc to relion

#In this case, motion correction is /data/cryosparc/v12/jon/P8/J2 Extracted particles are in /data/cryosparc/v12/jon/P8/J4, Homogenous refined (New) particles are /data/cryosparc/v12/jon/P8/J6, and Relion directory is /data/Jon/20200811RelionTest

#first need to link motioncorrected images to the relion directory
cd /data/Jon/20200811RelionTest
#Important that the following J2/motioncorrected directories are made in the relion directory
mkdir J2/
cd J2
mkdir motioncorrected/
cd motioncorrected
ln -s /data/cryosparc/v12/jon/P8/J2/motioncorrected/*.mrc -t .
#relion does not read as .mrc only as .mrcs so need to change extension for all files
rename .mrc .mrcs *.mrc

#Now need to link the extracted particles to the relion directory
cd /data/Jon/20200811RelionTest
#Important that the following J4/extract directories are made in the relion directory
mkdir J4/
cd J4
mkdir extract
cd extract
ln -s /data/cryosparc/v12/jon/P8/J4/extract/*.mrc -t .
#relion does not read as .mrc only as .mrcs so need to change extension for all files
rename .mrc .mrcs *.mrc


#go back to relion folder
cd ../..
module load pyem

#Use the particle.cs and passthrough.cs files from the final iteration for conversion
csparc2star /data/cryosparc/v12/jon/P8/J6/cryosparc_P8_J6_005_particles.cs /data/cryosparc/v12/jon/P8/J6/P8_J6_passthrough_particles.cs J6Particles.star
#Now just need to replace all mrc extensions to mrcs in the final star file
sed -i 's/particles.mrc/particles.mrcs/g' J6Particles.star
sed -i 's/dosweighted.mrc/dosweighted.mrcs/g' J6Particles.star
