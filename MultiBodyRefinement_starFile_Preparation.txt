#Running Multi-body-refinement is not difficult, but making in the input mask star file is not simple.
#Here I show how to make the input mask star file.
#Otherwise, look at Sjors multibody-refinement tutorial for more details on running.

#First need to do a 3DRefinement job of particles

#Next, define the regions from refinement that you want to focus on. 
#Save maps for nucleosome and binding factors in your relion folder, these are then in /data/Jon/RelionTest
#Maps are saved in RelionTest folder as NucleosomeOnly.mrc and BindingFactorOnly.mrc
#Important to save these maps in relion folder, as these are the reference maps to be used later
#Make mask for the nucleosome in relion, this is now MaskCreate/job10/mask.mrc
#Make mask for binding factor in relion, this is now MaskCreate/job11/mask.mrc

#Now need to determine relative order of movement. Most likely nucleosome will be stable, and binding factor rotates
#Also need to determine how much rotation will occur and by how many pixels (see Sjors tutorial for more info)
#I chose nucleosome to be subtracted first, and that the binding factor will rotate 20 degrees by 5 pixels

#Make .star file with all this information in a terminal (I like to use gedit)

cd /data/Jon/RelionTest
gedit

#In text file type the following, changing the mask, order of subtraction, angle, pixels, and reference map appropriately

data_
loop_
_rlnBodyMaskName
_rlnBodyRotateRelativeTo
_rlnBodySigmaAngles
_rlnBodySigmaOffset
_rlnBodyReferenceName
MaskCreate/job10/mask.mrc 1 10 2 NucleosomeOnly.mrc
MaskCreate/job11/mask.mrc 2 20 5 BindingFactorOnly.mrc

#Now save this as a .star file in your Relion Folder. Now ready to run the refinement.
