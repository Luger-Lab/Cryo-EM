#Need to get fix_star_mrc_format.py and fix_star_mrc_format.py from Sam and place in your folder
#Need to extract particles and run 3D refinement of those particles in cryosparc. That is P1/J1/particles_exported.cs here.
#Need to run motion correction in relion, that is in job1/mircrographs here

#Order of operations: 1) Export Job from Cryosparc (using "Export Job" button in Cryosparc interface that shows up when you click on a job)
#                     2) Run the csparc2star command, in the format as shown below
#                     3) Convert your .mrc files to have "_" instead of "." (this is the MotionCorr2 convention), as well as any custom string conversions, using "fix_star_mrc_format.py"
#                     4) Import the outputted .star file from "fix_star_mrc_format.py" to relion
