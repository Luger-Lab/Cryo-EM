#Moving files extracted in cryosparc, from relion back to cryosparc

#Selected Particles in relion that want to be moved to cryosparc are in job187
#Extracted particles in cryosparc are in P8/J777/extract

#First read your job187/particles.star file

head -50 job187/particles.star

#Lots of information here, all you need to look at is the format of the linked doseweighted_particles. 
#They should be in *.mrcs, we need to convert them to *.mrc

#Make new directory in your user titled with reference to relion job
mkdir Jon/job187particles
cp job187/particles.star data/Jon/job187particles/Newjob187particles.star

sed -i 's/particles.mrcs/particles.mrc/g' Newjob187particles.star

#Now make new directory in the Jon/job187particles directory for cryosparc particles
cd /data/Jon/job187particles
mkdir J777/extract
cd J777/extract
ln -s /data/cryosparc/jon/P8/J777/extract/*.mrc -t .

#Now can import into cryosparc like normal particle stack!
