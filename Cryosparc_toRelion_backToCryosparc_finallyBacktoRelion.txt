#moving particles motion corrected/CTF corrected in cryosparc, processed in relion, moved back to cryosparc, and finally back to relion

#In this case, particles imported into cryosparc are J1 in /data/cryosparc/v12/jon/P8/J1, Homogenous refined particles are /data/cryosparc/v12/jon/P8/J2, and Relion directory is /data/Jon/20200811RelionTest

cd /data/Jon/20200811RelionTest
#Important that the following J1/imported directories are made in the relion folder
mkdir J1/
cd J1
mkdir imported
cd J1/imported
ln -s /data/cryosparc/v12/jon/P8/J500/extract/*.mrc -t .
#relion does not read as .mrc only as .mrcs so need to change extension for all files
rename .mrc .mrcs *.mrc

#go back to relion folder
cd ../..
module load pyem/9.20 cuda/8.0 cryosparc/2.4

#Use the particle.cs file from the final iteration for conversion
csparc2star /data/cryosparc/v12/jon/P8/J2/cryosparc_P8_J501_005_particles.cs J2Particles.star
